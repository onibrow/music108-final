# Music 108 Final

## Seiya Ono

### Notes

This program was written in Python 3, usable in both terminal or Jupyter notebook format. To run an experiment, edit the `final.py` file and change the file name of the original WAV file recording. The default is 40 experiements, but that can be tuned to fit the needs of the experiment.
